General
---------
This data set was provided by Samsung who has researched human activities detected from data measured by accelerometer and so forth devices in a smartphone. Now it's a good material for computational statistics disciplines. You can also download the data from UCI website (  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones ). You will see source, data information and citation, etc. there.
